For homework3, I did the following items:
Problem 1:
I choose the Congressional Voting Records Data Set, and I extend the attributes into 3 types: n, y, ?.
Trainset has 423 examples
Testset has 12 examples
The ID3 I implement has a 91.67% of accuracy over a test set of 12 examples.

Problem 2:
Implementation of the ID3 decision tree alrorithm.

Additional Credit 3:
For continuous value attributes, the decision tree would bipartite the dataset into < and >= two subset.
It's compatible with dataset consisting of mixed category and continuous attributes. It uses a different set of classes:
Attribute, CategoryAttribute, RealNumAttribute, Attributes, Dataset, Example...
that are all defined in id3_real.py
It's not campatible with the original main.py, since the Attributes and Dataset classes are different.
So I have main_real.py.
Use case:
python main_real.py id3_real class --attributes dataset/realnum/processed/iris_attrib.txt --train dataset/realnum/processed/iris.dat --test dataset/realnum/processed/iris_test.dat

I also prepared Iris dataset to demonstrate this works.
For Iris dataset, 30 data is chosen from 150 examples as the testset, and it's classified with 100% accuracy.
